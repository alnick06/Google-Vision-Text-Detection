In this project, I was tasked with programmatically inputting handwritten surveys from Paving the Way Foundation. 
Paving the Way Foundation is trying to promote sex trafficking awareness with these essays they get an idea of what the public opinions
and knowledge is at a baseline. However, they have to hire people to convert them from handwritten text to text on the computer. In the
interest of saving time and money. I attempted to use Googles Vision API to accomplish this task in a fraction of the time.
